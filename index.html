  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this analysis we explore some trends that female labour force participation (LFP) has followed since 1980 in OECD countries.
</br>After finding that WLFP has grown at very different rates, and up to various levels, 
in different regions of the world –being </br> particularly high in Nordic countries– we use visualization tools to dig deeper into some potential partial explanations for this phenomenon.</p> 

For example, public policies incentivizing the substitution of leisure or household work with market labor </br> might partially explain higher this country-level differences.</p>

    <p> Choose a variable to explore how it correlates with female LFP (remember: this is merely exploratory!). </br> We can start with public sector size, as measured by total taxation ratio to GDP... </p>
