  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> In this analysis we explore some trends that female labour force participation (LFP) has followed since 1980 in OECD countries.
</br>After finding that female LFP has grown at very different rates, and up to varying levels, 
in different regions of the world –being </br> particularly high in Nordic countries– we use visualization tools to dig deeper into some potential partial explanations.</p> 

<p> For example, could public policies inducing the substitution of leisure or housework with market labor -such as childcare- </br>  help explain these country-level differences?</p>

    <p> First, some simple correlations. Choose a variable to explore how it relates with female LFP (remember: this is merely exploratory!). </br> We can start with public sector size, as measured by total taxation ratio to GDP... </p>

  <h2> What Kind of Public Expenditures? </h2>
<p> So, government size is correlated with female LFP. That doesn't tell us much yet: what are the <bold>mechanisms</bold> through which </br> government spending affects female LFP...
</br> It might be worth it to dig a bit deeper and break public expenditures by type.</p>

<p> Are any spending branches clearly correlated with the gender LFP gap? 
We can explore this by choosing any spending type with the buttons below...</br> </br> 

(P.S. gender LFP gap -analogous to the gender wage gap- is male LFP as a fraction of female LFP) </p>

<h2> Treemap: Daily Time Use Per Gender </h2>
<p> So, once "unpacking" total public expenditures by branch, we can find no clear correlation between any of them with gender </br>  LFP gap - which is a bit surprising in the case of social welfare expenditures. What we can see in the data, is that expenditures in family welfare programs (e.g. childcare services, paid parental leave, and the like) does seem to be correlated with female LFP. And in this case there would be a mechanism: </p>

<p> If it is the case that higher family welfare spending incentivizes women to enter (or stay in) the workforce, then that should be reflected </br> 
 in the way they allocate their time during the day.</br> 

For instance, we'd expect more even gender distributions </br> of time allocation to daily activities (especially in the case of paid and unpaid labor) in countries with higher social expenditure levels. </br>
(P.S. Unpaid work mainly includes child and elderly care, as well as housework) </p> 

<p> In the treemap below each square of which represents the minutes allocated by a sample survey participant per gender and per OECD country </br>
to certain daily activity. We can notice wide time use differences between genders in "big family-spending" countries and the rest, </br> with Mexico, Turkey and Japan being at the opposite extreme than the Nordics - in line with their respective family program spending distributions.</p>

<p> It seems though, that, globally, women spend more daily time engaging in unpaid labor and less in paid work, study, and leisure.</p>
