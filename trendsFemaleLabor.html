  <h1>Interactive Visualization Project: Check 2</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> In this analysis we explore some trends that female labour force participation (LFP) has followed since 1980 in OECD countries.
</br>After finding that female LFP has grown at very different rates, and up to various levels, 
in different regions of the world –being </br> particularly high in Nordic countries– we use visualization tools to dig deeper into some potential partial explanations.</p> 

<p> For example, could public policies inducing the substitution of leisure or housework with market labor -such as childcare- </br>  help explain higher these country-level differences?</p>

    <p> First, some simple correlations. Choose a variable to explore how it relates with female LFP (remember: this is merely exploratory!). </br> We can start with public sector size, as measured by total taxation ratio to GDP... </p>

  <h3> What Kind of Public Expenditures? </h3>
<p> So, government size is correlated with female LFP. That doesn't tell us much yet: what are the mechanisms through which </br> government spending affects female LFP...
</br> It might be worth it to dig a bit deeper and break public expenditures by type.</p>

<p> Are all of them correlated with the gender LFP gap? </br>
  We can explore this by choosing any spending type with the buttons below...</br> </br> 
(P.S. gender LFP gap -analogous to the gender wage gap- is male LFP as a fraction of female LFP) </p>

  <h3> Treemap: Daily Time Use Per Gender </h3>
<p> So, almost all spending types appear uncorrelated (bunch of scatter clouds) with gender LFP gap - except two: Social benefits/transfers and education </p> 
<p> Focusing on the former, if it is the case that higher public social welfare spending incentivizes women to enter (or stay in)  the workforce (i.e. public spending  </br> 
as a "causal mechanism"),  then that should be reflected in the way they allocate their time during the day, expecting  more even gender distributions </br> of daily unpaid work in countries with higher social expenditure levels. </br>
(P.S. Unpaid work mainly includes child and elderly care, as well as housework) </p> 

<p> As we can explore in the treemap below, there are wide time use differences between genders in "big family-spending" countries and the rest, </br> with Mexico, Turkey and Japan being at the opposite extreme than the Nordics - in line with their respective social spending distributions.</p>
<p> It is quite clear, though, that, globally, women spend more daily time engaging in unpaid labor and less in paid work, study, and leisure.</p>
