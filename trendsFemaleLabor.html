  <h1>Global Trends in Female Labor Participation </h1>
<h2> Interactive Visualization Project</h2> <p>    Elena Badillo Goicoechea  |   March 22, 2019  </p>
 </br>  
  
 
<p> In this exploratory dashboard we analyze some trends that female labor force participation (LFP) has followed  </br> 
 in OECD countries since in the last few decades <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. </br>  
</br>

Noticing that female LFP has grown at very different rates and up to varying levels in different regions (being </br> especially high in Nordic countries) we can use visualization tools to dig deeper into some possisble explanations.</p> 

<p> For instance, could public policies incentivizing the substitution of leisure or housework (e.g. childcare) for </br>
 market labor help explain these country-level differences?</p>

  <h2> What socio-economic factors characterize countries with higher female LFP? </h2>

  <p> We might first want to ask if countries with higher female LFP share some other characteristics.</br> </br> 
    Choose a variable below to explore how <b><span style="color:#9DB0B0">labor market outcomes</span></b>, <b><span style="color:#9CBA9C">development metrics</span></b>, and <b><span style="color:#A19D9D">public sector</span></b> variables relate to </br> 
  female LFP - remember: this is merely exploratory!</br> 
   We can start with government size: </p>

  <h2> What Kind of Public Expenditures? </h2>

<p> From a policymaker's perspective, the fact that government size is correlated with female LFP is interesting, </br>
 but doesn't tell us much by itself. Are there any specific <bold> mechanisms </bold> through which government spending </br> 
 impacts female LFP, or is it just a mere correlation?
</br></br> To better understand this, it might be worth it to dig deeper into countries' public sector structures by breaking </br>expenditures by type.</p>

<p> Are any spending branches clearly correlated with the gender LFP gap? </br> Explore this by choosing any spending branch using the dropdown below, and slide along its evolution since the 90's:</br> </br> 

(P.S. gender LFP gap -analogous to the gender wage gap- is male LFP as a fraction of female LFP) </p>

<h2> Daily Time Use By Gender </h2>

<p> So, once "unpacking" total public expenditures by branch, we can find no clear correlation between any of them with gender </br>  LFP gap - which is a bit surprising in the case of social welfare expenditures. </br></br>

What we do see in the data (you can return to the scatterplot!), is that the ratio of expenditures in family welfare programs </br> (e.g. childcare services, paid parental leave, and the like) seem to be quite correlated with female LFP.</br> </br> 

In this case there would be a clear mechanism: if it is the case that higher family welfare spending incentivizes women to enter </br>  (or stay in) the workforce, then it should be reflected in the way they allocate their time during the day.</br> For instance, we'd expect more even gender distributions of time allocation to daily activities (especially in the case of </br> paid and unpaid labor) in countries with higher social expenditure levels. </br></br>
(P.S. Unpaid work mainly includes child and elderly care, as well as housework) </p> 

<p> In the treemap below, the area of each square represents the proportion of global (OECD) daily amount of minutes spent in certain </br> 
  type of activity contributed by a sample survey participant of each gender, for each country. </br> </br> 
By pressing the button at the right you can see the data nested the other way round - so for each country we see how time </br> 
is allocated between genders.

We can notice wide time use differences between genders in "big family-spending" countries and the rest, </br> with Mexico, Turkey and Japan being at the opposite extreme than the Nordics - a divergence also shown in their family spending ratios.</p>

<p> It seems though, that, globally, women spend more daily time engaging in unpaid labor and less in paid work, study, and leisure.</p>
